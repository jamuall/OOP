Implemented the N matrix type which contains integers. These are square matrices that can contain nonzero entries only in their first and last column, and in their main diagonal. 
It doen't store the zero entries. It stores only the entries that can be nonzero in a sequence. Implemented the followin methods: 
getting the entry located at index (i, j), 
adding and multiplying two matrices, 
and printing the matrix (in a square shape).
